# Mountains-Necklace
I want a 3D model of the necklace I’m going to make in my jewelry class, just something that shows what it’ll look like before I actually build it.
here a picture of the model fully put together not broken into sections. one of fusion and one printed out. i will be making this shape in silver in a  few days hopefully ill share what it looks like when done then
